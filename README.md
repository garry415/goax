# Goax Mobile

A golang mobile (gomobile) compatible version of the Axolotl ratchet 
forked from @rakoo's goax package.

  https://github.com/rakoo/goax

This is very experimental. The current (1.5) version of Gomobile is very restrictive and 
requires work to repurpose existing golang packages. 

In addition, this version of Axolotl is completely out of date. It was based on @agl's 
pond code. 

Don't use this for anything important.

At some point, this will support iOS, Android, and server encrypted messaging with a single golang codebase.
